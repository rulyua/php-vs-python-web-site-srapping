Nektr Extracts Live Resin – Captains Pink,0,$40.00,$55.00,In stock,",https://speedgreens.co/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/nektr-extracts-cap.png","<div class=""description woocommerce-product-details__short-description""><p><span style=""color: #ff9900;""><strong>Captains Pink<br/></strong></span>is an indica dominant hybrid strain (80% indica/20% sativa) created through crossing the delicious Pink Kush with another unknown indica hybrid strain. Known for its insanely gorgeous appearance, Island Pin Kush is perfect for any indica lover who appreciates a delicious flavor, too. Island Pink Kush buds have neon green airy spade-shaped nugs with vivid hot pink hairs and a coating of frosty sandy white crystal trichomes. As you pull apart each sticky little nugget, aromas of pungent skunk and fresh vanilla and sweet florals are released. The flavor follows the same profile, with a sweet vanilla candy overtone accented by fresh flowery skunk and earth. The Island Pink Kush high is just as addictive as the flavor, with lifted and relaxing effects that are perfect for kicking back with friends. The high starts with an influx of cerebral euphoria, launching you into a state of pure happiness and hazy bliss. As your mind soars, you’ll start to feel a lightly tingly body high sneaking up on you, before it suddenly takes ahold and drops you into a state of pure relaxation and ease. With these hard-hitting effects and its high 24-27% average THC level, Island Pink Kush is perfect for treating chronic pain, appetite loss or nausea, insomnia, and depression.</p><div class=""hide-me""><p dir=""ltr""><strong><span class=""size""><span style=""color: #ff9900;"">Nektr Live Resin: </span></span></strong></p><p><em>Live Resin is an extraction form of a cannabis flower that contains the highest level of terpenes preserved within the Butane Hash Oil. Live resin often offers the best flavor profile compared to any other BHO extractions. It calls for freezing freshly harvested marijuana buds and freezing them under subcritical temperatures before the actual extraction process. The freezing part of the process retains the majority of the terpenes and maintains the taste and flavours of the cannabis flower with this extraction method.</em></p><p class=""font_8""><span style=""color: #ff9900;""><strong>Nektr Extracts</strong></span> is looking to bring an elevated experience to the world of concentrates.
